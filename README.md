## Running locally

### 0. Create a new Slack App

- Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
- Click **Create App**
- Choose a workspace
- Enter App Manifest using contents of `manifest.json`
- Click **Create**

Once the app is created click **Install to Workspace**
Then scroll down in Basic Info and click **Generate Token and Scopes** with both scopes

### 1. Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your tokens:

```env
# Slack Bot Tokens
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-actual-bot-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-actual-app-token

# OpenAI API Key (required for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Getting your tokens:**
- **Slack tokens**: Follow the app creation steps above
- **OpenAI API key**: Get from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 2. Setup your local project

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Change into the project
cd slack-agent/cora/

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Start servers

### 4. Test Cora's AI Features

#### Direct Messages
Send a DM to Cora with any business question:
```
"How can I improve customer retention for my SaaS business?"
"What are the best marketing strategies for B2B companies?"
"Help me create a growth strategy for my startup"
```

#### Channel Mentions  
Mention Cora in any channel:
```
@Cora what are some effective lead generation tactics?
@Cora help me optimize my sales funnel
```

#### Interactive Features
- Click buttons for interactive responses

## How Cora Works

1. **Mention or DM**: @mention Cora in a channel or send a direct message
2. **Processing**: Cora shows a "thinking" indicator while generating a response
3. **AI Response**: Receive tailored business advice using OpenAI's GPT models
4. **Thread Support**: Responses maintain context in threaded conversations

## Cost Considerations

- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model (~$0.15 per 1M input tokens)
- Responses limited to ~400 tokens for cost efficiency
- Rate limiting prevents excessive usage (10 requests/minute per user)

## Architecture

- **`app.js`**: Main Slack bot application with event handlers
- **`aiService.js`**: OpenAI integration module with streaming and rate limiting
- **`manifest.json`**: Slack app configuration

## Configuration

### System Prompt
Cora is configured as a Decision Intelligence and Business Growth expert with:
- Professional, non-AI persona
- Concise, actionable advice
- Slack-native formatting
- Industry-specific insights
- Ethical and legal considerations

### Customization
- Modify the system prompt in `aiService.js` to adjust Cora's expertise
- Update rate limits and token limits as needed
- Add conversation memory for enhanced context (optional)

## Troubleshooting

- **No AI responses**: Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Rate limit errors**: Users are limited to 10 requests per minute
- **Formatting issues**: Cora uses Slack formatting (*bold*, _italic_), not Markdown
